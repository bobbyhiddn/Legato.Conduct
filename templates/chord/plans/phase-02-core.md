# Phase 2: Core Implementation

## Goal

Implement the main functionality of the project.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Core business logic implemented
- [ ] Data models created
- [ ] Service implementations complete
- [ ] Unit tests for all core functionality
- [ ] Error handling in place

## Tasks

### 2.1 Data Models

Implement the core data structures:

- Define entities
- Create DTOs
- Implement validation

### 2.2 Business Logic

Implement the main functionality:

- Core algorithms
- Business rules
- Processing pipelines

### 2.3 Services

Create service implementations:

- Implement interfaces from Phase 1
- Add dependency injection
- Handle lifecycle

### 2.4 Testing

Comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests for all services
- Edge case coverage
- Error path testing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All core functionality works
- [ ] >80% test coverage on core logic
- [ ] Error messages are clear
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code follows patterns from Phase 1

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 complete
- Base interfaces defined
- Test framework in place

## Estimated Complexity

High - this is the main implementation phase.
