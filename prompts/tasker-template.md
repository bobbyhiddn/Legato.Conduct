## Example Rendered Tasker

```markdown
## Tasker: MCP Bedrock Adapter

### Context
From voice transcript 2026-01-07-1530:
"I need an MCP server that can wrap AWS Bedrock in our JWICS environment.

in classified environments (JWICS).

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MCP server responds to tool discovery requests
- [ ] Supports `bedrock:complete` tool for text completion
- [ ] Handles AWS STS authentication with assumed roles
- [ ] Includes configuration for different classification levels
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality

### Constraints
- Follow patterns in `copilot-instructions.md`
- Reference `SIGNAL.md` for project intent
- Write tests for new functionality
- Keep PRs focused and reviewable

### References
- Source transcript: `transcript-2026-01-07-1530`

## Usage Notes

- Keep the context section focused - include only relevant transcript content
- Acceptance criteria should be specific enough for automated testing
- Constraints section is standard and shouldn't be modified
- Always include the footer for traceability
